# Density profile of Vector Fuzzy-Dark matter
Contains mathematica code for solving SP eqn

Topic Introduction: Aside from the usual matter(made up proton, neutron and electron) with which we interact everyday, physicists have long-believed the existence of another type of invisible matter that engulfs most galaxies in the Universe, including our own Milky-way galaxy. Unlike the everyday matter around us, this unseen matter is not known to have any direct contact with the former, hence aptly named "dark matter". Over the past several decades, through extensive and meticulous study of different cosmological phenomenon and observational data, majority of the scientific community strongly argues for the existence of dark matter, and thus is a topic of active research.
